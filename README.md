This is a demo dataset using [cldfbench](https://github.com/cldf/cldfbench) to create CLDF datasets from multiple sources.
It combines data from the following sources:
1. Large vocabulary lists for 10 Indian languages from https://spraakbanken.gu.se/projekt/digital-areal-linguistics, based on the concepts in [IDS](https://ids.clld.org/) and [WOLD](https://wold.clld.org/)
2. Collected words for 'water' for 23 Sino-Tibetan languages
3. Randomly generated words for the other concepts for these 23 languages

This is a demo dataset using [cldfbench](https://github.com/cldf/cldfbench) to create CLDF datasets from multiple sources.
It combines data from the following sources:
1. Large vocabulary lists for 10 Indian languages from [Spr√•kbanken](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/projekt/digital-areal-linguistics), based on the concepts in [IDS](https://ids.clld.org/) and [WOLD](https://wold.clld.org/)
2. Collected words for 'water' for 22 Sino-Tibetan languages
3. A LIFT lexicon export from an example [FLEx](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/) database containing some entries for [Bulu Puroik](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/bulu1255), converted with [cldflex](https://gitlab.com/florianmatter/cldflex)
4. Randomly generated words for the other concepts for the 22 Sino-Tibetan languages
